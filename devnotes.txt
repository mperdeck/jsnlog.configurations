The files in directory Source\content\Scripts are copied by the 
jsnlog.js/minify.bat 
script

When somebody runs 
nuget update-package
to update their version of JSNLog,
the changes made by the old version to web.config are rolled back, and then the new version
makes its own changes. Same goes for the contents of the Scripts directory.

This means that if you were to release a version of JSNLog that does not have script files,
then if somebody upgrades, they will magically lose their script files and their site will break.
